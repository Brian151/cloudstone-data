usually when MMOs have files updated, the original is replaced
sometimes, new directories are created
a common theme, however is that old versions are deleted.
in cloudstone, this did not happen
in cloudstone, game files were suffixed with their version and never deleted

in my attempts to clone the server, data was found for old versions of the game
quite possibly, every version released, maybe some that weren't
most files were simply duplicates and nothing significant changed
however, pugmain (the client) occassionally went-through noteworthy changes

{files}

pugmain.swf:
v9459 : old version with unreleased minimap island (island deleted later)
v14730 : version with halloween island on mini-map (island added and deleted with the halloween event being cycled. data for halloween island was itself, never deleted)
v14814 : most recent and final game version

multiple other versions of this file were found, but nothing seemed significant

staticdata.json:
the core config file
unlike other files, this file was prefixed with its version
it also was duplicated thousands of times, rather than old versions deleted
the intended function of this file was to store everything about the in-game objects and items
it also links the assets up. 
because of the functionality of linking assets to game objects, this file basically doubles as a map of the asset server
it has been suffxed with "E" as late in the game's life, compression was used. it's a ~7.5MB text file, this makes perfect sense

characterviewer.swf:
name says all

pugpreloader.swf:
obligatory flash game preloader

{directories}

avatar:
player avatar features and equipment

backgroundSets: backgrounds for the maps

breakableSets: map objects that can be destroyed

cache : actual location on the server of staticdata.json

core > admin : swfobject.js

css : stylesheets for HTML wrapper

doodadSets : mostly map objects and walls

homeProducers : special decorations used for the player home's farm

images : splash screens and cutscenes, shop promo screens, and feed images (remember, CS was a social game!)

interactableSets : map scenery that could be interacted with

islands : island overworld maps, every island has one besides easter island and the special quests that eventually broke-down

itemSets : collectable items (pets and equipment bundle icons with the in-game sprites)

js : various scripts, most are for messing with the HTML DOM. "useful" ones presumably defunct without servers to connect to

monsterSets : creatures hostile and not

mp3 : music

mp4 : empty

npcData : NPC stats and equipment inventories

projectiles : empty

questCharacters : mugshots of certain characters or places, typically appeared on right side of screen to annoy you

soundSets : sound effects (not in MP3 files this time, SWF bundles)

TEST_STREAMING : empty

tilesets : map tiles

zones : map data

{missing}
a handful of files despite being listed in staticData.json do not seem to exist
maybe they were never on the server, or maybe they actually were deleted
some of these were actually requested by the game client, but nothing happened other than a 404 error in browser console
